# rollup-plugin-rust

Rollup plugin for bundling and importing Rust crates.

This plugin internally uses [`wasm-bindgen`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/).

`wasm-bindgen` is automatically installed, you do not need to install it separately.

## Installation

First, make sure that [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed.

If you are on Windows, then you also need to install the [Visual Studio build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16) (make sure to enable the "C++ build tools" option).

Lastly, run this:

```sh
yarn add --dev @wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust
```

Or if you're using npm you can use this instead:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to your `rollup.config.js`, and now you can use `Cargo.toml` files as entries:

```js
import rust from "@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust";

export default {
    input: {
        foo: "Cargo.toml",
    },
    plugins: [
        rust(),
    ],
};
```

You can import as many different `Cargo.toml` files as you want, each one will be compiled separately.

See the [example folder](/example) for a simple working example. First run `yarn install`, and then `yarn watch` for development. Use `yarn build` to build for production.

When compiling multiple crates it is recommended to use a single shared [workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-workspace-section) to improve compile times.

### Importing `Cargo.toml` within `.js`

It is also possible to import a `Cargo.toml` file inside of a `.js` file, like this:

```js
import wasm from "./path/to/Cargo.toml";

async function loadWasm() {
    const exports = await wasm();

    // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
}
```

This will load the Rust `.js` glue code synchronously, but the Rust `.wasm` code will be loaded asynchronously (which is why the `wasm` function returns a `Promise`).

If you instead want to load *everything* asynchronously, you can use dynamic `import`, like this:

```js
async function loadWasm() {
    const wasm = await import("./path/to/Cargo.toml");
    const exports = await wasm.default();

    // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
}
```


### Usage with Vite

This plugin works out of the box with Vite, however Vite has SSR, which means that it runs your code on both the server and browser.

This can cause errors when loading Wasm files, so you need to disable SSR when loading the Wasm:

```js
import wasm from "./path/to/Cargo.toml";

async function loadWasm() {
    if (!import.meta.env.SSR) {
        // This code will only run in the browser
        const exports = await wasm();

        // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
    }
}
```


### Customizing the import URL

At build time you can use the `serverPath` or `importHook` build options (described below) to customize the import URL for the `.wasm` file.

However, sometimes you need to customize the URL at runtime. In that case you can pass the `serverPath` or `importHook` options to the function (they behave the same as the build options):

```js
import wasm from "./path/to/Cargo.toml";

async function loadWasm() {
    const exports = await wasm({
        // This will replace the directory with `/foo/`
        serverPath: "/foo/",

        // This will prepend `/bar/` to the import URL.
        importHook: (path) => "/bar/" + path,

        // This allows for customizing the initialization of the WebAssembly module.
        // This is primarily useful for doing multi-threading with Workers.
        initializeHook: (init, path) => init(path),
    });

    // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
}
```

Usually you only need to pass one or the other, not both. Use `serverPath` for replacing the entire directory, and use `importHook` for prepending or doing more advanced things.

## Build options

The default options are good for most use cases, so you generally shouldn't need to change them.

These are the default options:

```js
rust({
    // Directory on your server where the .wasm files will be loaded from.
    // This is prepended to the URL, so you should put a / at the end of the directory,
    // for example "/foo/".
    serverPath: "",

    // Whether the code will be run in Node.js or not.
    //
    // This is needed because Node.js does not support `fetch`.
    nodejs: false,

    // Whether to build in debug mode or release mode.
    // In watch mode this defaults to true.
    debug: false,

    // Whether to display extra compilation information in the console.
    verbose: false,

    // Whether to inline the `.wasm` file into the `.js` file.
    //
    // This is slower and it increases the file size by ~33%,
    // but it does not require a separate `.wasm` file.
    //
    // If this is `true` then `serverPath`, `nodejs`,
    // and `importHook` will be ignored.
    inlineWasm: false,

    // Extra arguments passed to `cargo build`.
    cargoArgs: [],

    // Extra arguments passed to `wasm-bindgen`.
    wasmBindgenArgs: [],

    // Arguments passed to `wasm-opt`.
    wasmOptArgs: ["-O"],

    // Which files it should watch in watch mode. This is relative to the Cargo.toml file.
    // Supports all of the glob syntax: https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob
    watchPatterns: ["src/**"],

    // Allows you to customize the behavior for loading the .wasm file,
    // this is for advanced users only!
    importHook: function (path) { return JSON.stringify(path); },

    // These options should not be relied upon, they can change or disappear in future versions.
    experimental: {
        // Changes the way that the modules are generated. Normally you import Rust like this:
        //
        //     import wasm from "./path/to/Cargo.toml";
        //
        //     async function loadWasm() {
        //         const exports = await wasm();
        //
        //         // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
        //     }
        //
        // But now you import Rust like this:
        //
        //     import { foo, bar } from "./path/to/Cargo.toml";
        //
        //     // Use functions which were exported from Rust...
        //
        // You might need to set the Rollup `format` to "es" or "system".
        directExports: false,

        // Whether the Wasm will be initialized synchronously or not.
        //
        // In the browser you can only use synchronous loading inside of Workers.
        //
        // This requires `inlineWasm: true`.
        synchronous: false,

        // Creates a `.d.ts` file for each `Cargo.toml` crate and places them
        // into this directory.
        //
        // This is useful for libraries which want to export TypeScript types.
        typescriptDeclarationDir: null,
        
        // Whether to transpile the wasm output to JS using wasm2js tool.
        // Note that this option may slow down your application.
        //
        // This requires `inlineWasm: true`, `directExports: true` and `synchronous: true`.
        transpileToJS: false,
    },
})
```

### Chrome / Firefox extensions

If you are creating a Chrome / Firefox extension you may need to use `importHook` to customize the loading behavior, like this:

```js
rust({
    importHook: function (path) {
        return "chrome.runtime.getURL(" + JSON.stringify(path) + ")";
    },
})
```

This is necessary because extension files are put into a separate URL namespace, so you must use `chrome.runtime.getURL` to get the correct URL.

If you want to use inline wasm with extensions, the browser will treat it as remote wasm execution and may block it.
To avoid this, you can use the `transpileToJS` option, which will transpile wasm to JS.
Keep in mind that this option may slow down your extension.

```js

### Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to customize some aspects of this plugin:

* `CARGO_BIN` is the path to the `cargo` executable.
* `WASM_BINDGEN_BIN` is the path to the `wasm-bindgen` executable.
* `WASM_OPT_BIN` is the path to the `wasm-opt` executable.

If not specified, they will use a good default value, so you shouldn't need to change them, this is for advanced uses only.
